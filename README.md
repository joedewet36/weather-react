Project Name
Overview
This project is a modern web application built with React, TypeScript, and Node.js. It offers a robust and scalable fullstack architecture, integrating a responsive frontend with a powerful backend API. The application leverages TypeScript for type safety, ensuring a maintainable and reliable codebase.

Features
Frontend: React with TypeScript, React Router, and state management (e.g., Context API or Redux).
Backend: Node.js with Express for RESTful API design.
Database: MongoDB (or other, depending on configuration).
Testing: Unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library (frontend) and Mocha/Chai (backend).
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js (version 14+ recommended)
MongoDB (local instance or cloud, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
Git
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
Install dependencies for both the server and client:

bash
Copy code
# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the server directory with the following values:

env
Copy code
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
Run the Application
Start the MongoDB server:

bash
Copy code
mongod
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm start
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
cd ../client
npm start
The application will now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Design Decisions and Trade-Offs
React with TypeScript: Chosen for its powerful type safety and ability to catch errors at compile time, enhancing maintainability and scalability. Trade-off: Slightly steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with TypeScript.

Node.js with Express: Lightweight and efficient for building RESTful APIs. Trade-off: Lacks out-of-the-box solutions for certain backend tasks compared to larger frameworks.

State Management: Used Context API for simplicity and avoiding Redux boilerplate. Trade-off: May require migration to Redux for more complex state scenarios.

Database Choice (MongoDB): Non-relational database chosen for flexibility with unstructured data. Trade-off: Relational databases might be preferred for applications with complex joins.

Component-Based UI: Designed reusable React components for a modular and maintainable frontend. Trade-off: Initial time investment in creating reusable components.

Unit Testing
Frontend Testing
Framework: Jest and React Testing Library.
Test focus:
Component rendering
Event handling and state updates
Integration of API calls with mock data
Run frontend tests:
bash
Copy code
cd client
npm test
Backend Testing
Framework: Mocha with Chai for assertions.
Test focus:
API endpoints
Business logic
Database interactions with mock databases
Run backend tests:
bash
Copy code
cd server
npm test
